# About

The purpose of this app is to provide a desktop scratch pad for some quick notes, allowing you to create and manage multipl notes from one small window, using markdown to lay them out.

Yes, I have no good name for it yet, feel free to suggest one :D

The app uses [HyperMD](https://laobubu.net/HyperMD/?directOpen#./docs/index.md) to automatically render the markdown inline, so there's no 
need for a split view mode or an edit/view mode split.

It's written in typescript using Vue and Electron. I'm new to Vue and using this app as a way of learning it just for fun, but also to build something I find useful.

Please review code, submit bugs, and make PRs as you wish!
